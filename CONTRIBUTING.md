## Cross-repo development

cello-client consumes `@cello-protocol/interfaces` from npm. The root
`package.json` already has a `pnpm.overrides` entry that points to a local
sibling checkout when both repos are checked out side-by-side:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "@cello-protocol/interfaces": "file:../trustless-cello/packages/interfaces"
  }
}
```

When both repos are checked out as siblings (`trustless-cello/` and
`cello-client/` in the same parent directory), this override is already
active. You only need to build interfaces before running `pnpm install`:

```bash
# In trustless-cello — build interfaces first
cd /path/to/trustless-cello
pnpm --filter @cello-protocol/interfaces run typecheck   # produces dist/

# In cello-client — install resolves the sibling path automatically
cd /path/to/cello-client
pnpm install    # do NOT use --frozen-lockfile in local dev
```

Interface changes in trustless-cello are immediately reflected in
cello-client after rebuilding interfaces — no publish cycle needed.
